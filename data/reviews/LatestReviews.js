    review: "This hotel is called the Gallery because it is literally an art gallery too! Even the furniture was eclectic. It is located very close to downtown Greenport which is full of shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again.",

    review: "A charming place to stay. With only 10 rooms, you feel like your at home. Bright colors throughout, there's ample space to hang out and have your privacy, inside and out. The bed was comfortable, and the breakfast is perfect for starting your day. Breakfast lasts until 11, so theres no rushing. Great location. Will come back again.",

    review: "Nice hotel, great town. Great boutique hotel, stayed in private suite, clean and spacious- only complaint is that the bathroom didn’t have a true shower, more of a jacuzzi soaking tub with handheld shower. Worked fine, no big deal. Short walk to town(2 blocks).",
